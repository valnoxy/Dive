## üîî Information
Dive (formally deploya) is a little application for deploying Windows on a machine. 

- Deploy WIM-Files on any drive.
- Mass deploy Windows with AutoDive.
- Bypass Windows 11 Microsoft-Account compulsion
- Capture Windows installation
- Install Windows from the Cloud

## üîß Usage
1. Download the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/valnoxy/dive/releases).
2. Use Rufus to extract the Dive-ISO to your USB flash drive.
3. Create a new Folder called "WIMs" on your USB flash drive.
4. Copy your WIM-Files to the "WIMs" Folder. You can extract the WIM file from every Windows iso between Windows Vista and higher. 

> **Note** In some cases, you will only find a ESD file instead. In that case, you'll need to convert the ESD file to a WIM file. You can follow [this guide](https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/163540-convert-esd-to-wim) to do so.
